# CS:GO Competitive Configs

When you're going to set up a CS:GO server for your local CS:GO LAN or an online tournament, this problem always comes up. What CS:GO config should be used for the tournament?
  
The combination of these configs should solve your problem. The configs are built for usage in a CS:GO Major based on a rulebook ([link](https://counter-strike.net/csgo_major_supplemental_rulebook)) provided by Valve. The config works without any other tournament system, but in our case it has been used with [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO).  
  
There are a few settings that are not in the rulebook, and a few that have been diverted from the rulebook (with OK from Valve). Those settings are commented in the configs.

# Installation

In this setup all config files and nicknames.txt should be installed in the `cfg` directory. 

# Locked nicknames

Back in 2017 Valve added a [feature](https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2017/10/19582/) for locking nicknames for SteamID's which is commonly used by tournament organizers. A copy of this file is also located here (mostly to make it easy for others, but also showing how the file works).
